    <p>Le Lyu is a code-slinging aficionado who can teach Python to kids, troubleshoot Java in his sleep, and write enough JavaScript to break the internet—and maybe even your browser's heart (`undefined is not a function`, anyone?). From building a healthy lifestyle app that convinces college students to take a few steps (while JavaScript promises not to trip over its own promises) to teaching STEM to kids, Le brings creativity and humor to every project. With a GPA that proves he’s no `NaN`, he’s here to make sure that—unlike JavaScript—his work always has a clear definition.</p>
